# Analysis-of-COVID-19-Cases-in-U.S.A

•    Executed outlier detection, feature engineering, and visualization for 30,000+ data points with 10+ characteristics. 

•    Created comprehensive Tableau dashboards and stories to visualize and communicate the findings effectively. 

•    The project validated hypotheses showing urban areas had 30% higher vaccination rates than rural areas, the Delta 
     variant caused a 60% case spike, ethnic mortality differences, and a 30% drop in savings

**Project Description:**

The primary data set is county-wise data on hospitalization due to COVID-19 in New York state for the year 2021. The secondary data set includes total number of tests performed and number of people who tested positive for COVID-19. For this project, we are considering two counties, namely Bronx and Erie. All facility names, facility network, number of patients admitted, discharged and expired, hospital staff and beds available, and patients’ age groups, are represented in the primary data set. The secondary data set includes the total number of tests performed, the number of positive results, and the COVID-19 positivity percentage as per different counties. We aim to compare healthcare services provided among these counties and how COVID-19 affected people in the 20-44 age groups using data visualization techniques.

**Objective:**

These data sets will be used to visualize and determine which county provides better hospital services by considering factors like the number of staff, number of beds, ICU wards, etc., and the effect of COVID-19 in Bronx and Erie counties of New York state during the time of COVID 19 in 2021.

**Hypothesis:**

• Whether the People in Bronx County are less likely to get affected by COVID-19 than People in Erie County.

• Does the age group 20- 44 are hospitalized less as compared to the age group 55 -64 because of younger age?

• Whether the INDEPENDENT hospital network in Erie County has less treatment scale than the CATHOLIC HEALTH network and KALEIDA HEALTH network.

• Does less hospitalization happen in second quarter in Bronx County as compared to the first quarter because better prevention measures have been taken?

• Whether patients in ICU are more likely to expire in Bronx County than in Erie County.

• Whether patients affected by COVID-19 are more likely to expire in Bronx County as compared to Erie County.

• Weather patients

Dataset: https://health.data.ny.gov/Health/New-York-State-Statewide-COVID-19-Testing/xdss-u53e/data
Records:

• In the primary Data set we have 171K Rows and 37 columns.

• In the secondary data set we have 67.8K Rows and 8 columns.

**Visualization:**

In order to get reliable visualization, we will first clean the dataset using Python. Further, we will be using Tableau as our visualization tool due to its salient features:

• Intuitive dashboard with the ability to create representations simply using drag and drop.

• Tableau can recommend and select the best visualization based on the data and attributes selected.

• Capability to work with multiple data sources and handle large datasets.

• Easy to try multiple visualization types and choose one that best serves your interests.
